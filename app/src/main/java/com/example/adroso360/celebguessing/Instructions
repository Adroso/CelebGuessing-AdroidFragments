Guess the celebrity app

Technical purpose: Dynamically apply fragments to an activity depending on device orientation.

Requirements:

The app must include two fragments (check out the support screencast with a simple demo)
A MainFragment - for the game play
A SecondaryFragment - for game configuration
When the app is in portrait mode, the MainActivity shows the app toolbar and the MainFragment - the app toolbar contains a settings button that opens up a SecondaryActivity that contains the SecondaryFragment
When the app is displayed in landscape mode, both fragments are visible side-by-side - and the app toolbar must not be visible
The MainFragment needs an ImageView and a GridView of items (2-6)
Use the ImageView to display the face of a famous person
The items should the names of different famous people
The player wins but selecting the correct name for the currently displayed famous person from the list of names - use a Toast to inform the user when they are correct or incorrect
Use a set of at least 5 famous people in your game
The SecondaryFragment is used to select the number of names available in the GridView during gameplay
